# Smash Ultimate Discord Bot

_A discord bot that simplifies access to Smash Ultimate news and information._

### Functionality ###
* `!un/subscribe` - subscribes the current discord channel to getting new music / new news when available
* `!mlatest` - links to the most recently posted song
* `!mfind` - finds the link to the song via title
* `!maintheme` - link to the main theme
* `!char` - fighter lookup via id
* `!help` - lists the commands

### What's next? ###
* More commands! E.g. `!latest` for blog posts, `!char` lookup via name, `!mfind` lookup via composer... etc
* Database for subscribed channels so restarting the bot doesn't wipe the current list of subscribed channels.
* Get outsider ideas and PRs to make this bot even better!

### Running ###
You'll need the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library to run this bot.
Simply type `python3 SmashNewsBot.py` to run the bot.
